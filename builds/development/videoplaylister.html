             Under the heading of “Theatrical Elements” or “Set” you look at where and when the film takes place and how the characters look, what they wear and how the actors express their roles.

        <h3>PLOT</h3>        
        <div class="top_tekst">
          <p>
             Under the heading of plot or “Storytelling” you look at how the story is told and what its theme and message might be. You use what you found out while working with the theatrical elements and cinematic technique and dig deeper to find out for instance whose points of view the film represents, how tension is created and how knowledge is distributed between both different characters and the audience. You can say you look at the what and why of the film
